# luat-esp32-c3-wiki
Collection of notes and resources from my experience using Luat's ESP32-C3 board

## Motivation

The ESP32-C3 is a microcontroller with Wifi & BLE, which makes it exciting for a lot of stuff. But one of the features I really like, is its based on RISC-V, not ARM! I want to support this open standard, so writing programs targeting this architecure seemed like a good place to start.

## Purchasing

I purchased the board [from Taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=666579064570), where it is available for just 12.9RMB
